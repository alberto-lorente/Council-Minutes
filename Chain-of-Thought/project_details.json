It also references the use of geothermal heat pumps and the favorable conditions for geothermal energy in the area. These references indicate that the document is related to a geothermal project.",

However, it does not mention any specific initial budget for the project. The text discusses various elements such as water management, biodiversity, urban development, and energy management, but there is no explicit reference to financial details or budget allocations. Therefore, based on the information provided, the initial budget of the project cannot be determined, and a default value of 0 is assigned.",

However, it does not explicitly mention the final cost of the project. The text discusses various elements such as biodiversity, water management, energy, and risks, but no financial figures or cost-related information are provided. Therefore, the final cost of the project cannot be determined from the given text, and a default value of 0.0 is used to satisfy the schema requirements.",

However, the document is a detailed report on the Local Urban Plan (PLU) of Neydens, which typically involves a comprehensive planning process. Given the extensive nature of the report, which includes environmental assessments, risk management, and urban planning considerations, it is reasonable to assume that the project duration would span at least one year. Therefore, the estimated duration is inferred to be 365 days.",

        "actual_duration_chain_of_thought": "The project description mentions that the article was published on 2020-11-01 and refers to a report from 2017. Assuming the project started in 2017 and the article was published in 2020, the duration of the project would be from 2017 to 2020. Calculating the number of days between 2017-01-01 and 2020-11-01 gives us 1460 days."
