        "initial_budget_chain_of_thought": "Upon reviewing the document, it mainly consists of the minutes of a municipal council meeting. It includes election results, budget decisions, participation fees for communal services, and other local administrative topics. However, the document does not explicitly mention an 'initial budget' figure typical for a new project or annual budget setting. Instead, it discusses a 'Budget Principal: d\u00e9cision modificative N\u00b03' which involves a reallocation of existing budgetary funds amounting to changes of +100,000 \u20ac in maintenance and corresponding -100,000 \u20ac in transfers to various sections. This is not indicative of an 'initial budget' but a modification of an existing budget. Hence, the initial budget of the project is not clearly specified in the document as it focuses on budget adjustments rather than starting budgets.",
        "final_cost": 1200.0,
        "final_cost_chain_of_thought": "Upon reviewing the given text, various financial figures and decisions are mentioned. However, most of these are related to budget allocations for specific municipal projects, school fees, and administrative decisions rather than a final project cost. The only section that specifically references an allocation for a project is under the section titled 'Subventions' which discusses financial contributions towards various causes. Here, the sum of 1,200 euros is mentioned in the context of funding of school Christmas events ('No\u00ebl des \u00e9coles'). This budget allocation appears to be a project-related cost and is explicitly stated, making it the probable candidate for the 'final cost of the project' in this context.",

        "estimated_duration_chain_of_thought": "Analyzing the provided text, there is one main project mentioned: the proposal and re-structuring around the communal events and infrastructure maintenance, specifically addressing the state of the Salle des F\u00eates.\n\n- **Salle des F\u00eates Work**: The project begins with the dismantling of the ceiling, insulation, roofing, and the removal of asbestos which is currently in progress. This requires careful coordination and execution to ensure safety and follow regulations.\n- **Detailed Plan**: After dismantling, dust measurements will be taken, the roof will be covered, and the building will be dried.\n- **End Date**: It seems this work is already in progress, and the calendar indicates some events transitioning to January 2024.\n\nI estimate these works, considering their complexity and scheduling around communal rhythms, to likely run for approximately 14 days, assuming some overlap with standard work weeks and quick phases, as detailed actions like dust tests and moisture control are usually rapid but must follow the structural safety and testing conclusion. Hence, the overall anticipated duration, considering logistical and unforeseen delays (such as legal case mentions), rests at about two weeks. The potential transition period mentioned is the key indicator of pace.",
        "actual_duration": 183,
        "actual_duration_chain_of_thought": "1. The document is from a municipal council meeting held on November 14, 2023.\n2. It mentions specific timelines in the ONF-\u00c9tat d'Assiette 2024 section:\n   - The abatement of undergrowth and small stands is to occur by April 15, 2024.\n   - The clearing of the same areas is scheduled by October 15, 2024.\n3. From April 15 to October 15 is exactly 6 months.\n4. The actual duration between these two dates is 183 days, considering all calendar days within the range.\n\nBased on these observations, the actual duration of the project spans 183 days."

The document includes decisions, orders, and notices primarily related to environmental, zoning, and local government operations.\n3. Typically, a project's initial budget would be explicitly stated using terms such as \"budget initial,\" \"financement,\" or monetary units such as \"euros.\"\n4. I scanned through the detailed description, looking for any mentions of budget, monetary values, financial allocations, or specific projects that typically have an associated budget.\n5. The document doesn't provide any specific numerical values or discussions about financial budgets, allocations, or project funding.\n6. Based on the details available, there appears to be no information on an initial budget, or it might not be applicable to the nature of the listed administrative acts.\n7. Thus, I concluded that the initial budget of the project is 0, as it was not specified in the provided text.",

It does not explicitly mention any financial elements or numerical figures related to a final cost of a project. Therefore, based on the provided data, there is no information reflecting a final monetary cost associated with any project.",

The use of the phrase 'au titre de l'ann\u00e9e 2023' indicates that the tasks should be carried out throughout the entirety of 2023, suggesting a complete annual cycle. Therefore, the estimated duration for these activities is 365 days.",

        "actual_duration_chain_of_thought": "To find the actual duration of the project, I will identify the relevant sections in the text that provide clear start and end dates or periods for the provided projects. In this document, there are multiple decisions and orders with specific dates. However, the only identified duration pertains to the 'Arr\u00eat\u00e9 pr\u00e9fectoral du 25 ao\u00fbt 2023 portant dissolution du SIVU EPCI MORTEAUX-COULIBOEUF'. The document states dates related to various sections, but specifically mentions the decision was taken on 25th August 2023 and addressed in a separate section, showing three pages in length. There is no explicit start and end date for a project because these are administrative decisions not specifically tied to a project timeline. However, in the context here of understanding a duration from a publishing perspective, the publication covered listings of 3 pages regarding a decision from 25th August. Hence, the most visible duration specifiable from document length is 3 pages, interpreting via the listings as grasped directly from the text."
