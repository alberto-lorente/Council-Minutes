PLANNING OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ACCELERATION ZONES Deliberation No.: D202349 Subject of the deliberation Renewable Energy Acceleration Zones Law No. 2023-175 of March 10, 2023 relating to the acceleration of renewable energy production aims to accelerate and simplify projects for the establishment of energy producers and to respond to the challenge of local acceptability. As part of this planning exercise, municipalities identify acceleration zones for the establishment of land-based renewable energy production facilities. This will make it possible to respond in particular to the challenges of energy control, solidarity between territories and ecological transition while giving back control to local elected officials. According to article L141-5-3 of the energy code, these zones are defined, for each category of sources and types of renewable energy production installation: wind, photovoltaic, methanization, hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, taking into account the necessary diversification of renewable energies according to the potential of the territory concerned and the power of renewable energies already installed. For a project, the fact of being located in an acceleration zone does not guarantee its authorization, it must in all cases comply with the applicable regulatory provisions and in any event the instruction of the projects remains done on a case-by-case basis. In this same logic, a project can therefore also be authorized outside the acceleration zones. In this case, a project committee will be mandatory. This committee will include the various stakeholders concerned by a renewable energy project, including neighboring municipalities. In compliance with the legal framework, to define these acceleration zones, the Municipal Council took note of the conclusions of the debate within the intercommunal community council of October 24, 2023, which made it possible to verify the consistency of the acceleration zones identified with the territory's project. Considering that the municipality is located in the adhesion area of ​​the National Forest Park, it cannot therefore define acceleration zones with the exception of rooftop processes. However, a zone may be identified relating to ground-based photovoltaics: ° Project prior to this law concerning plots ZC N°2-3 5-6-10 and 12; E N°435-437 and 451. On this subject, it is recalled that this agri-photovoltaic project is led by a young farmer and that it benefits from the support of the Municipal Council. In view of these elements, the Municipal Council proposes to retain the acceleration zones for the installation of land-based energy production facilities: + __ Solar photovoltaic / thermal on buildings: plots presented on the map in the appendix, subject to the prior agreement of the Architect of Buildings of France. *__ Solar photovoltaic on the ground: Agreement for the agri-photovoltaic project presented above. After deliberation, the Municipal Council unanimously decides: * _ To identify the acceleration zones referred to above. + __ To instruct the Mayor to transmit this deliberation to the Communauté de Communes des Trois Forêts. AVAP PROCEDURE Deliberation No.: D202350 Subject of the deliberation Abandonment of the AVAP procedure Unanimously For: 11 Against: 0 Abstentions: O The Mayor recalls the deliberations numbered D202117 of November 2, 2021 concerning the AVAP procedure which became SPR (Sites Patrimoni to the Remarkables) decided by the municipality in 2015; and D202251 of November 29, 2022 affirming its wish to continue this approach knowing that it is the CC3F (Communauté de Communes des Trois forêts) which ensures the competence in this matter. The Mayor explains to the Municipal Council that after having participated in a meeting organized by the CC3F, and considered replacing the AVAP with a Programmed Housing Operation, it now seems to him useless to continue on this path since the PLUI will provide answers to most of the questions concerning the housing to be preserved. After having deliberated, the Municipal Council unanimously decides: + To propose to the CC3F the abandonment of the AVAP procedure with regard to the municipality of Arc en Barrois.
