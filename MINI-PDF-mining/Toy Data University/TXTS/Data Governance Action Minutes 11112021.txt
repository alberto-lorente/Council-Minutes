Data Issue Request: Student Leadership and Engagement visibility of vaccinated (Luke Ifland)
Request for selected staff to have access to view vaccination status as required per city
regulations for events. The staff already have access and am seeking approval for easier access
to confirm status on the spot.
Comments:
Donna Davis does not consider this information to be HIPPA type data and has no objections.
Is the data coming directly from med proctor? Architecture, once information is confirmed by
med proctor, integration to banner table, vaccinated, exempt, blank, then tied to one card.
There is no medical record information, simply a “y” for yes or “ex” or blank, have neither.
MP – Banner – Salesforce
Only Natalie has admin role to med proctor database.
Motion: Approved Vote: unanimous. Only on a required and need to know basis.
Good of the order:
Bromfield shared the Law School faculty may be interested in doing something with the gender
identity pronoun data.
Darcy feels there is a missing piece we promised the students. How are we using this data. The
data is currently used in class roster and the policy addresses this use.
Might be a good start to have Bromfield draft an email to deans and having direction from one
source.
If faculty wants to do further research, it should be handled by internal institutional data, not
by CIPE.
May consider including the data use and sharing subcommittee. Bromfield is involved when
students submit research requests.
Action: Bromfield to draft email to associate deans and deans
