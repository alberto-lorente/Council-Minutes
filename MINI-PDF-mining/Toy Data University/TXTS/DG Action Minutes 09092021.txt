Bromfield agreed it is more a use issue and not data governance and perhaps a question to legal counsel
whether it falls under data retention.
Smith shared it may also fall under risk assessment and not data governance.
Panter added possible law suits can come up.
Wilson shared the graduation office has had to re-record ceremonies if a student’s honors did not get
announced. Some have threatened to sue.
Kirmse mention Shawn Calhoun is looking for ITS to approve technology that will automatically post
photographs to Gleeson Instagram account.
Hamrick will speak to Ryder to clarify the issue.
Data audit policies -inbound / outbound information. Don’t do any formal data audit of these data
between USF and third-party vendors. Different controls in place to prevent data issues, some data
assessment, but nothing formal. At the request of Donna Davis, discuss and explore if this is needed or
not?
Hamrick stated any data worth collecting is worth having certain level of quality, otherwise there would
be no use for collecting the information. If a system has bad data, it can be a liability to the institution.
Zane added there are some validation of data integration that feeds into finance.
What system does anyone suspect has poor data? Siloed systems, not single sign-on.
Kirmse and Hamrick will follow up on a policy for annual audits. ITS has a list of all systems.
Good of the order
Meeting adjourned: 4:55 p.m.
